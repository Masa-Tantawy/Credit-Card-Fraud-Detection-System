# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-System

One of the most common and prevalent forms of financial technologies is credit cards as almost every individual above the age of 18 nowadays holds at least 1 credit or debit card. In fact, many countries are creating channels to allow those below this age to use one since banks are the main place to store money. With this in mind, this technology must be made very safe to use, meaning that the chance of fraudulent transactions must be minimized. 
Conspicuously, technological advances have the capacity to operate on these massive numbers of transactions unlike humans and can be of higher accuracy. In other words, machine learning models can be utilized to implement an effective credit card fraud detection solution making them safer to use.

The aim of this project is to design utility app and a model using the best-performing machine learning algorithm to identify whether or not a future transaction, given its details, is fraudulent or legitimate. After 5 phases, the final model used is a Random Forest. In addition, a utility app was design to allow classification of a transaction inputted by the user.

The 5 phases are:
- Phase 1: Problem Identification & Project Specification
- Phase 2: Data Preparation, Cleaning, and Feature Generation
- Phase 3: Pilot Study of all supervised machine learning models 
- Phase 4: Model Design
- Phase 5: Model & Utility Application Implementation

Note: There are some issues/ mistakes in a few phases that are corrected in the following phase.
